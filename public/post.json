The Fox News host is something of a folk hero in Russia: Because of the pro-Putin propaganda he so often spews, the Kremlin has encouraged Russia's state TV to air as much of Tucker's face as possible — and they're certain to love his latest rant about how Putin is winning the war in Ukraine, which does not seem to be the case. But on Fox News, what Tucker says goes."

Marts Center in Wilkes-Barre, Penn. on Tuesday Aug. 30, 2022. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)   It is time to give President Joe Biden his due. While Biden's approval rating doesn't reflect it, Uncle Joe is on a roll. After some bumpy months, gas prices are dropping, unemployment is at record lows, the job market is booming, incomes are rising, a top al-Qaida leader was taken out, the first Black female Supreme Court justice was seated, NATO has expanded, and Biden unified European support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia."
